Contact the visa application centre to see if you can change your appointment.

If you have paid the standard fee and you cannot get an appointment in the time you need, you can cancel your application and choose a premium service instead. This will allow you to get an appointment more quickly. You can only get your fee refunded if the application hasnâ€™t been processed.

Log in to your immigration application to cancel your application and upgrade to a premium service.
