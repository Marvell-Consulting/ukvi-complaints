If you have paid the standard fee and you cannot get an appointment in the time you need, you can cancel your application and choose a priority service instead. This will allow you to get an appointment more quickly.

You can only get a refund if you have not had your fingerprints or other biometric data taken.

Log in to your immigration application to cancel your application and upgrade to a priority service.
