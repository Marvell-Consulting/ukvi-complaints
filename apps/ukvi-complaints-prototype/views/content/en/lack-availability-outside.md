If you have paid the standard fee and you cannot get an appointment in the time you need, you can cancel your application and choose a priority service instead. This will allow you to get an appointment more quickly.

You can only get a refund if the application hasnâ€™t been processed.

Log in to your immigration application to cancel your application and upgrade to a priority service.
